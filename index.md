Privacy Policy – CV Tools

Effective Date: 18 Feb 2026

CV Tools (“the app”) is an offline productivity app designed to help users create professional documents (CV/Resume and letters) and manage PDF files using on-device tools.

1) Information We Collect

We do not require account creation or login.
We do not collect personal information on our servers.

The app may access files you choose to work with, such as:

Documents and PDFs you open in the app

Images you select to convert to PDF or use for OCR/text recognition

Files you save/export from the app

All such content remains on your device unless you explicitly share it using your device’s share options.

2) How We Use Your Information

The app uses your selected files only to provide features such as:

Creating/editing document templates

Exporting documents to PDF

PDF tools (merge, split, compress, watermark, signature, protect/unlock)

Converting PDF/images and extracting text

OCR/Text recognition performed on your device

3) Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.
Any sharing happens only when you use the share feature to send a file through another app (e.g., email, WhatsApp, Drive).

4) Internet Use

CV Tools is primarily designed to work offline. Some device services may require internet connectivity (for example, system services or updates). The app does not upload your documents or files to our servers.

5) Permissions

The app may request permissions only to enable core features, such as:

Storage / Files access: to open, save, and export PDFs/documents

Photos / Media access: to import images for conversion or OCR

Camera (optional): if you choose to capture images for OCR or PDF creation

You can manage permissions anytime from your device settings.

6) Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your content by keeping processing on-device. However, no method of storage on a device is 100% secure. We recommend using a device lock and keeping your OS updated.

7) Children’s Privacy

This app is not designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

8) Your Choices & Data Deletion

You control your files. You can delete any documents created by the app at any time from within the app (if available) or by deleting the app’s files/folders from your device storage. Uninstalling the app also removes app data stored locally.

9) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
